# RiboAlloc

<img src="riboalloc.jpg" width="500px"/>

A minimal model of ribosome allocation between endogenous and synthetic genes within a cell. The code is developed in MATLAB and has been tested using MATLAB 2014b. The model is defined in `riboalloc.m` and an example of how it is used is given in `riboalloc_example.m`.

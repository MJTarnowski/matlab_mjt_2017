%% stochastic simulation algorithm - direct method

% Q1
% in terms of concentrations, these are what the reaction  propensities are
% equal to:

% v1 = k1*x1^2;
% v2 = k2*x2*x3;

% Q2
k1 = 1;
k2 = 2;

khat1 = (2*k1*1*10^9)/((6.022*10^23)*(5*10^-15))
khat2 = (k2*1*10^9)/((6.022*10^23)*(5*10^-15))

% units of both are s^-1

%% sw carpentry - lecture notes

% key takeaway: be consistent
% anything you can't communicate with code, you communicate with commments

% function has to have same name as the file - put main one on the top
% you can then have sub/nested functions 
% however these sub/nested functions are only accessible within the file
% rather than outside the file

% to access a specific function from command line, it needs to be saved in
% its own file of same name


%classes do exist in matlab but aren't used that much

% if subfunctions are in separate files they can still be accessed from a
% function in a different file

% you dont really need end for sub functions, just required for nested

%nested functions require ends
% you can think of nested functions like lambda functions (python) or
% anonymous functions (also in matlab)
% nested functions can access parent variables without them needing to be
% accessed by each function in its arguments (like subfunctions)

%% GUIs in MATLAB

% GUI might be useful for demo of your group project in the final week
% use global vbles with caution because if they are changed many places
% within your code because it's hard to see what's happening to the global
% variable

%% projects

% -genetic osc - 2D ode - guyantes & poyatos
% -image reconstruction
% -ODE models of infection
% -cancer spatial modelling - cellular automata, continuum PDE model -
% matrices / DE
% - data analysis of flocking behaviour - starlings - paper + dataset -
% analyse the velocity of the flock or visualisation or model

%% my first matlab file
% Q what is the difference between saving and publishing?
% A seems to be that publishing spits out a box of what the code in
% the file does whereas saving just saves the data in the file


function test

disp("hello")

end


%% this is how you add titles

% this is how you add notes/comments

%this is how you add variable names:
%_name_

%add latex equations using:
% $$ y = x $$

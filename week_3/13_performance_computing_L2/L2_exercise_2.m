%% Exercise	2:	MATLAB	built-in	algorithms.
% code analyser report output:

% 1 Input argument 'previousSolution' might be unused. If this is OK,
% consider replacing it by ~. 
% 21 INV(A)*b can be slower and less accurate than A\b. Consider using A\b 
% for INV(A)*b or b/A for b*INV(A). 


% time results for different sections:
%    0.0019    0.0219    8.8932    0.0445    0.0053    0.1339    0.0001

% improvement occurs in section 5: there is a 600 fold improvement in terms
% of speed!
